v3.2.0
------
* Removed zoom button and added zoom functionality on mouse / touch events ("hovering")
* Changed fullpage view to occupy only 90% of the document width / height, and added a way to leave fullpage mode by clicking outside the "modal"
* Added close button to fullpage view
* Changed resize_dom_objects() to resize zoom canvas properly in accord with the canvas container size
* Added a new marker mode (with setting "new"/"old") for zooming; NB. setting "new" loads all large images on initialization (otherwise, zoom view would flicker)
* Added start-image-id setting to make the player start rotating from a different image (to avoid autoplay ending on a frontal view)

v3.1.0
------
* Split zoom-mode property into mobile and desktop variants
* Set "marker" as the default zoom pointer and "outbox" as the default zoom mode on desktop, "inbox" on mobile
* zoom_canvas is now a separate element from the thrixty div in the DOM, and acquired by its ID thrixty_zoom_canvas_N (where N is player_id + 1)
* Added rotation speed gauge that also responds to ArrowUp/ArrowDown events
* is_mobile is now based on client width/height instead of user-agent
* Zoom now stops on window resizing (to get rid of the outbox when orientation changes to portrait)
* Fixed ID generation on initialized DOM objects such that IDs are actually unique in the case of multiple players, and reworked CSS to operate on classes instead
* Removed outbox-position setting (should be handled by CSS)

v3.0.7
------
* Integrated express
* Minor corrections to readme file

v3.0.0
------
* Rewrote the player in TypeScript
* Removed some unused methods and parameters; rewrote parts of the code to be functionally equivalent
* Fixed keypresses method to use KeyboardEvent.key instead of the deprecated keyCode/which
* Fixed mouse events to use MouseEvent.button instead of the deprecated which
* Made pixel_per_degree a property of the ThrixtyPlayer (was a local variable)
* Fixed various is_zoomed checks to check for is_fullpage as well
* Fixed bug in set_marker_position() erroneously using width instead of height
* Rewrote the throttle decorator to work without a Date object
* Changed start_rotation() such that holding the ArrowDown key no longer causes the image to move too fast (instead, makes the image stand still)
* (CSS) Set max-height on #showroom so that mobile devices don't move the controls offscreen in fullpage mode
